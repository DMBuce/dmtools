= Rules Summary

== Rolls

If the Game Master (GM) asks for a STR, DEX, WIL, or Armor roll,
roll a d20, add the appropriate bonus,
and compare it against the Difficulty.
A roll that meets or exceeds the Difficulty is a success,
which means you accomplish what you set out to do.
An unsuccessful roll will be interpreted and described by the GM.

== Difficulty

The GM sets a global Difficulty and adjusts it as the situation changes.
The Difficulty is shown to the players at all times.

== Advantage

The GM may decide that a player character (PC)
has Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll due to their circumstances.
To roll with Advantage, roll two d20s and take the highest roll.
To roll with Disadvantage, take the lowest roll.

Advantage cancels Disadvantage.
Only roll one d20 if you have both.

= Combat

== Turns

Players who make a DEX roll take their first turn before the GM.
Then the GM takes their turn,
and play proceeds to the GM's left after that.

== Attacking

PCs roll STR when attacking in melee
and DEX when attacking at range.
Some magic attacks use WIL instead of STR or DEX.

== Defending

Enemies may attack on the GM's turn.
PCs roll Armor to defend against attacks.
Some magic attacks are defended against using WIL instead of Armor.
If the roll is unsuccessful, the PC takes damage.

== Damage

On a hit, the target chooses one undamaged Grit
or an undamaged STR, DEX, or WIL stat to take damage.
Rolls made with damaged stats have Disadvantage.
Rolls that PCs make against enemies have Advantage
if the target has a damaged stat.

If a PC or enemy takes damage
while all their Grit and stats are already damaged,
they fall unconscious.
Damage taken while unconscious means instant death.

When a PC dies,
the player can create a new character or take over a hireling.
To avoid downtime, they rejoin the group as soon as they're ready.

== Healing

After each combat, you can catch your breath for 5 minutes
and drink fresh water to heal one Grit.

Once per day, you or an ally can tend to your health
(bandage a wound, take a dose of medicine, etc.)
to heal one Grit.

Once per day,
you can eat a meal
and sleep for 6 hours
to heal all Grit and one stat.

//= Narrative Combat
//
//The players describe how they contribute to the fight.
//The GM asks each of them to roll STR, DEX, or WIL
//depending on what they described.
//Each PC takes damage from an enemy unless they beat the Difficulty.
//
//The player with the highest successful roll describes how the fight was won.
//If no roll was a success, the GM describes the outcome of the fight.

= GMing

== Managing Difficulty

This game has a single Difficulty (DC) that varies as the PCs' situation changes.
It's set by the GM and shown to the players at all times.

This is done to speed up gameplay and make it easier to run the game.
Players always know what number they're rolling against,
and the GM doesn't have to think of a DC for every action a player takes or
monster they might encounter.
Instead, the GM simply thinks of a DC
representing how hard or easy the current scenario is,
and displays it in a prominent location with a post-it or a d20.

A simple rule of thumb is to use
Difficulty 12 in relatively safe areas such as towns or a home base,
Difficulty 15 in unsafe areas such as dungeons and wilderness,
and Difficulty 18 in areas with villainous or world-ending threats.

== Monsters

This game is designed to make it easy to create monsters on the fly.
Since PCs roll to attack and also to defend,
monsters never need to roll and don't need bonuses assigned to their stats.
Since PCs always roll against the Difficulty,
monsters never need a monster-specific
"target number" or "difficulty class" to roll against.

A monster's stat block is just its name, stats, Grit,
and any abilities it has.
Stats and Grit are represented with checkboxes.
For example, a bear's stat block is _"Bear ☐☐☐☐"_.
The leftmost three checkboxes represent the monster's stats
and other checkboxes represent Grit.
The GM ticks off checkboxes from right to left as the monster takes damage.

Unlike PCs, monsters can have fewer than three stats.
For example, a goblin's stat block might be _"Goblin ☐"_.
A particularly weak stat block such as _"Goblin Minion"_ might have no stats,
in which case the monster is knocked out with a single hit.

In addition to a name, stats, and Grit, monsters can have abilities.
Here are some example stat blocks with abilities.

**Vampire** ☐☐☐::
Heals one stat when dealing damage with its bite.
Regenerates in its coffin when killed unless staked through the heart.

**Troll** ☐☐☐☐::
Regrows one limb and heals one stat at the end of its turn.

**Dragon** ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐::
Flies and breathes fire.

//== Loot

= Optional Rules

//== Character Creation: Heirlooms & Legacies

== Character Creation: Additional Training

If the setting and campaign support it,
the GM may wish to make the following training available
at character creation
or through mentors that the PCs meet during their adventures.

* **Academics:** History, lore, religion
* **Seafaring:** Sailing, swimming, navigation
* **Witchcraft:** Medicine, herbalism, alchemy

//== Combat Addition: Critical Successes and/or Failures

//== Combat Alternative: Hit Points
//
//The following are alternative rules for combat
//based on health and damage dice instead of Grit and stat damage.
//
//=== Armor & Health
//
//You start with 4 max health
//Instead of Grit, you gain +2 max health at even levels.
//Shields, chestplates, leggings, and similar protection
//provide 1 Armor each, to a maximum of 3.
//Armor reduces damage.
//
//=== Damage & Attacking
//
//To attack, roll damage and subtract the target's Armor.
//The target loses that much health.
//
//* **Unarmed:** Fists deal **d4** damage
//* **Weapon:** Weapons deal **d6** damage
//* **Magic:** Magic deals **d8** damage
//* **Ultimate:** Exceptional attacks add **d12** to the damage
//
//At 0 health, a PC falls unconscious.
//When a PC reaches negative health,
//they die in 1d4 turns unless stabilized with healing.
//
//When a PC dies,
//the player can create a new character or take over a hireling.
//To avoid downtime, they rejoin the group as soon as they're ready.
//
//=== Healing
//
//Once per hour, you can rest for 5 minutes
//and drink fresh water to heal 2 health.
//
//Once per day, you can take a dose of medicine
//to heal 2 health.
//
//Once per day,
//you can eat a meal
//and sleep in a safe place for 6 hours
//to heal all health.



//== How to Play
//
//At its core, the game is a conversation.
//One person plays as the Game Master (GM),
//and tells the other players what's happening
//in a shared fictional world.
//The other people describe what their characters
//a.k.a. Player Characters (PCs) do in response,
//and the GM describes how their actions impact the world.

//== Combat & Attacking
//
//When the GM introduces an enemy, they will describe it in detail.
//
//When you attack an enemy, describe how and where you try to hit it.
//The GM might ask to clarify what you're trying to accomplish with your attack.
//Either way, the GM will ask you to roll Strength (if using a melee weapon)
//or Dexterity (if using a ranged weapon) to see if you hit.
//If you damage the enemy, the GM will describe what happens.
//
//When you take damage, choose a stat to apply it to.
//Rolls with that stat are made with Disadvantage until it's healed.
//Damage can be healed with a Long Rest or certain magic items.
//
//If you take damage while all your stats are already damaged,
//you fall unconscious.
//If you take damage while unconscious, you die.
//
//Starting at 2nd level, you have Grit.
//Grit can be used to ignore damage.
//When taking damage, you can mark off a Grit space instead of an ability.
//Grit is healed with a Short Rest.
//
//Enemies and monsters don't have Health or Hit Points.
//Instead, they have limbs, 
//
//Savage Worlds: Shaken > Wounded x4
//
//Blades in the Dark: Stress xN > Trauma
//
//grit > shield/armor > stat damage > hard moves (unconscious/dying)
//
//When a PC is wounded, the player chooses
