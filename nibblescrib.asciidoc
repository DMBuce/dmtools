//named after a magic card and
inspired by
Maze Rats,
ICRPG,
Fellowship 2E,
Mausritter,
Cairn,
and
Knave.

= Rules Summary

== Stats

* **Strength (STR)**: brawn, toughness, and vigor
* **Dexterity (DEX)**: agility, reflexes, and swiftness
* **Will (WIL)**: force of personality and persuasion

Assign +0, +1, and +2 to your stats in any order
when creating a character.

If the Game Master (GM) asks for a STR, DEX, or WIL roll,
roll a d20, add the appropriate stat bonus,
and compare it to the Difficulty.

== Difficulty

The Difficulty is global, and usually 12 (easy), 15 (medium), or 18 (hard).
The GM will change the Difficulty as the situation changes.
The Difficulty is shown to the players at all times.

== Advantage & Training

A player's character (PC) can have Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll.
To roll with Advantage, roll two d20s and take the highest roll.
To roll with Disadvantage, take the lowest roll.
Advantage cancels Disadvantage.

Training gives you Advantage on rolls related to certain tasks.
You gain training at level 1 and each odd level after.
Choose your training from the following:

* **Athletics**: Climbing, leaping, balancing
//* **Education**: History, religion, arcana
//* **Seafaring**: Sailing, swimming, navigation
* **Stealth**: Sneaking, hiding, disguises
* **Survival**: Tracking, foraging, navigating wilderness
* **Thievery**: Tinkering, picking locks and pockets
//* **Witchcraft**: Medicine, herbalism, alchemy

== Inventory

You have 16 item slots.

* 2 hand slots for items you are holding and can use
* 2 strap slots for items that can be freely swapped with hand slots
* 4 body slots for armor and worn magic items
* 8 pack slots for items that take an action to find

Bulky items take up two slots. 
Your starting gear is:

* A melee weapon
* A ranged weapon
* An iron shirt
* A shield
* 3 Gear
* 3 Supplies

= Combat

Two options for tactical combat are provided,
Attrition & Gritty Combat,
are provided. The GM should choose one for the campaign or session.

A third, narrative combat option is provided for quickly resolving low-stakes
or uninteresting battles.

= Attrition Combat

== Armor & Health

You start with 4 max health and 0 Armor.
Shields, chestplates, leggings, and similar protection
provide 1 Armor each, to a maximum of 3.
Armor reduces damage.

== Damage & Attacking

* **Unarmed**: Fists deal **d4** damage
* **Weapon**: Weapons deal **d6** damage
* **Magic**: Magic deals **d8** damage
* **Ultimate**: Exceptional attacks add **d12** to the damage

To attack, roll damage and subtract the target's Armor.
The target loses that much health.

At 0 health, you fall unconscious.
When you reach negative health, you die in 1d4 turns.

When you die, you create a new character that inherits the dead character's
belongings, and the GM will introduce your new character as soon as possible.

== Turns

The player to the GM's left goes first and play proceeds to the right.

== Healing

Once per hour, you can rest for 5 minutes
and drink fresh water to heal 2 health.

Once per day, you can take a dose of medicine
to heal 2 health.

Once per day in a safe place,
you can sleep for 6 hours
and eat a meal to heal all health.

= Gritty Combat

== Attacking & Defending

PCs roll STR when attacking in melee
and DEX when attacking at range.
The GM may rule that thrown weapons use STR
and finesse weapons use DEX.

Some magic attacks use WIL instead of STR or DEX.

PCs roll DEX when dodging an attack
and STR when blocking an attack with armor.
If a dodge or block attempt is unsuccessful,
the PC takes damage.

== Damage

On a hit, the target chooses a stat to take damage.
Rolls made with damaged stats have Disadvantage.
Rolls against enemies have Advantage if the target has a damaged stat.

If you take damage while all your stats are already damaged,
you fall unconscious.
If you take damage while unconscious, you die.

When you die, you create a new character that inherits the dead character's
belongings, and the GM will introduce your new character as soon as possible.

== Grit

Starting at 2nd level, you have Grit.
You can choose one Grit to take damage instead of a stat.

== Turns

Players take free-form turns.
After each player turn, one enemy takes a turn.

== Healing

Once per hour, you can rest for 5 minutes
and drink fresh water to heal one Grit.

Once per day, you can take a dose of medicine
to heal one Grit.

Once per day in a safe place,
you can sleep for 6 hours
and eat a meal to heal all Grit and one stat.

= Narrative Combat

The players describe how they contribute to the fight.
The GM asks each of them to roll STR, DEX, or WIL
depending on what they described.
Each PC takes damage from an enemy unless they beat the DC.

The player with the highest successful roll describes how the fight was won.
If no roll was a success, the GM describes the outcome of the fight.

= Character Creation

Assign +0, +1, and +2 to your stats in any order.

If the GM is using the Attrition Combat rules,
you start with 4 max health, and your starting gear provides 2 armor.

Your starting gear is:

* A melee weapon
* A ranged weapon
* An iron shirt
* A shield
* 3 Gear
* 3 Supplies

The GM may have you start with an Heirloom or Legacy.

//== How to Play
//
//At its core, the game is a conversation.
//One person plays as the Game Master (GM),
//and tells the other players what's happening
//in a shared fictional world.
//The other people describe what their characters
//a.k.a. Player Characters (PCs) do in response,
//and the GM describes how thier actions impact the world.
//
//== Stats & Rolls
//
//PCs have three stats, each with an associated bonus:
//
//* **Strength (STR)** is your physical power, toughness, and vigor
//* **Dexterity (DEX)** is your physical grace, agility, and swiftness
//* **Will (WIL)** is your wits, perception, willpower, and charm
//
//When a PC is at risk or there's something on the line,
//the GM will ask the player to make a stat roll
//-- a Strength roll, a Dex roll, or a Will roll -- 
//against the Difficulty (DC).
//
//Note that it's *THE* Difficulty, not "a" Difficulty.
//Unlike some other games where every task and each stat of every monster
//has its own difficulty,
//this game has a single Difficulty that varies as the PCs' situation changes.
//The Difficulty is set by the GM.
//It is shown to the players at all times.
//
//This is done to speed up gameplay and make it easier to run the game.
//The GM doesn't have to think of a DC for every action a player takes or
//monster they might encounter.
//Instead, the GM simply thinks of a DC representing how hard or easy the
//current scenario is, and displays it in a prominent location with a post-it or a d20.
//Players can always look to see what number to roll against.
//
// //There are also some optional stats that the GM may or may not use:
// //
// //* **Attack (ATK)**: Ability to inflict harm
// //* **Armor (AMR)**: Protection against physical attacks
// //* **Health (HTH)**: Capacity for taking damage
//
//To make a stat roll,
//roll a twenty-sided die (d20) and add your stat bonus.
//A result higher than the DC is a success,
//while a result lower than or equal to it will be interpreted and explained by
//the GM.
//
//So for example, if the GM asks you to make a Strength (STR) roll and the DC is 15,
//you first roll a d20. Suppose you roll a 14. If your STR is +2,
//your total result is 16 -- higher than DC 15.
//You do the thing you set out to do. Success!
//
// //If you had instead rolled a 13 with +2 STR,
// //your result of 15 would
//
//=== Advantage & Disadvantage
//
//If a PC's circumstances give their roll Advantage,
//the player rolls two d20s and takes the higher roll before applying their modifier.
//On the other hand, a roll with Disadvantage is made by taking the lower roll.
//Advantage cancels out Disadvantage and vice versa.
//
//Rolls made with a damaged stat have Disadvantage.
//A PC can gain Advantage from their training, from being aided by another PC,
//from a tool, or from their surroundings.
//If you're not sure whether something gives you Advantage on a roll,
//ask the GM.
//
//== Combat & Attacking
//
//When the GM introduces an enemy, they will describe it in detail.
//
//When you attack an enemy, describe how and where you try to hit it.
//The GM might ask to clarify what you're trying to accomplish with your attack.
//Either way, the GM will ask you to roll Strength (if using a melee weapon)
//or Dexterity (if using a ranged weapon) to see if you hit.
//If you damage the enemy, the GM will describe what happens.
//
//When you take damage, choose a stat to apply it to.
//Rolls with that stat are made with Disadvantage until it's healed.
//Damage can be healed with a Long Rest or certain magic items.
//
//If you take damage while all your stats are already damaged,
//you fall unconscious.
//If you take damage while unconscious, you die.
//
//Starting at 2nd level, you have Grit.
//Grit can be used to ignore damage.
//When taking damage, you can mark off a Grit space instead of an ability.
//Grit is healed with a Short Rest.
//
//Enemies and monsters don't have Health or Hit Points.
//Instead, they have limbs, 
//
//Savage Worlds: Shaken > Wounded x4
//
//Blades in the Dark: Stress xN > Trauma
//
//grit > shield/armor > stat damage > hard moves (unconscious/dying)
//
//When a PC is wounded, the player chooses
//
//== Rest

//Short Rest (10 minutes): Use Supplies to clear your Grit of all damage.
//
//Long Rest (6 hours): Use Supplies to clear your Grit and stats of all damage.

//Add Heirloom or Legacy.
